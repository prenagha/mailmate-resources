# Mailmate Resources

My customizations to MailMate Resource files to:

* Customized header layout
  * * Show Name only (not Name and Address)
  * * Click search is against "Any Address" using address (not name)
  * * Gravatar avatar support for From, To, CC, BCC headers
  * * Fallback to domain favicon if Gravatar not found
  * * Use local avatar images for common addresses

* Customized Message Verifications

This directory is a sampling of what I have in ```/Users/me/Library/Application Support/MailMate/Resources```
